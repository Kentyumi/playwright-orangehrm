üöÄ CI/CD Integration

This framework is designed to be CI/CD ready.  
You can integrate it with **GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Azure DevOps**.

### Example: GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npx playwright test --reporter=html

      - name: Upload Playwright HTML report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report
